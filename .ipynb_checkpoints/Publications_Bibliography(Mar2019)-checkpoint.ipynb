This was a cross-sectional study. Patients with HIV and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts >500 were included. Semi-structured interview, the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were used.. Of the 119 cases included, 63% were men. The mean age was 35.5 ± 10.4 years. Among the patients, 103 (87%) had headaches, 53 (45%) had migraines, 50 (42%) had tension-type headaches, and 53 (45%) had substantial and severe impact of headaches. Eleven patients had headaches that started after they had been diagnosed with HIV. These patients had more migraines (72% vs 43%; P < 0.05), greater intensity (8 ± 2 vs 6 ± 2; P < 0.01), and impact (HIT-6: 60 ± 11 vs 51 ± 12; P = 0.02) of headaches compared to others HIV patients. There were no correlations between CD4 counts and the intensity, frequency, or impact of headaches.. HIV-positive patients had a high frequency of headaches, which had a great impact on patients' lives. The pattern most often found was migraine. There was no correlation between CD4 counts and the severity of headaches.\n",

      "\t a: Laughing is a rare precipitating factor for headaches, and the pathogenesis underlying laugh-induced headache (LH) remains unclear.. Two cases of headache triggered predominantly by laughing were presented in this article. We also reviewed the published English literature regarding LH, summarized the clinical characteristics of LH, and discussed the probable pathophysiological mechanisms.. In the first patient, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed cerebellar tonsillar herniation through the foramen magnum. In the second patient, we did not find any evidence of intracranial disease. The literature review showed that LH is a mild to severe, non-pulsating headache. In most cases, the duration of each attack was limited to a few minutes. The headache usually bursts after laughing and reaches its peak almost immediately. In some cases, the headache can only be induced by mirthful laughing rather than by fake laughing.. LH can be categorized as primary LH and secondary LH. Changes in the spatial structure in the posterior cranial fossa and cerebrospinal fluid circulation may contribute to the development of secondary LH. Primary LH, primary cough headache, and primary exercise headache may share some common pathogenesis. And we speculate that the regions of the brain associated with the expression of mirth might be associated with LH.\n",

      "\t a: Neuromodulation is an emerging area in headache management. Through neurostimulation, multiple brain areas can be modulated to alleviate pain, hence reducing the pharmacological need. In this review, we discuss the recent development of the vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) for headache management. Early case series from epilepsy and depression cohorts using invasive VNS showed a serendipitous reduction in headache frequency and/or severity. Noninvasive VNS (nVNS), which stimulates the carotid vagus nerve with the use of a personal handheld device, also demonstrated efficacy for acute migraine or cluster headache attacks. Long-term use of nVNS seemed to exert a prophylactic effect for both chronic migraine and chronic cluster headache. In animal studies, nVNS modulated multiple pain pathways and even lessen cortical spreading depression. Progression in nVNS clinical efficacy over time suggests an underlying disease-modifying neuromodulation. Noninvasive VNS appears to be as effective as the invasive counterpart for many indications. With an enormous potential therapeutic gain and a high safety profile, further development and application of nVNS is promising.\n",

      "\t a: It is commonly known that headaches are induced by intake of specific food, drink, and/or additive. In addition, some patients experience postprandial headache independent of ingestion of specific items. Currently, information on the pathophysiology underlying this particular type of headache is scarce.. We report two cases in which headaches were observed after each meal. Postprandial hypotension was demonstrated in both cases. Tonometry-based continuous blood pressure measurement during head-up tilt revealed sympathetic dysfunction. In one patient, meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy detected cardiac sympathetic denervation, and diagnosis of pure autonomic failure was made. In both cases, treatment of postprandial hypotension was effective in relieving postprandial headache.. The possibility of postprandial hypotension should be explored in patients with headache that occurs after meal. To this end, tonometry-based blood pressure measurement and MIBG myocardial scintigraphy may be useful diagnostic investigations. Treating postprandial hypotension may be effective in alleviating the symptoms.\n",

      "\t a: Given the safety concerns regarding pharmacological agents, and the considerable impact of headache and migraine on the sufferer's quality of life, many people seek other treatment options beyond conventional medication and care to address their symptoms; this includes complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Some CAM interventions have shown promising results in clinical trials of headache and migraine management. Nonetheless, there has been little research exploring the reasons for using CAM, and the types of CAM used, among this population.. The study aimed to answer the following questions: (1) Which CAM modalities are used most frequently among migraine/headache sufferers? and (2) What are the self-reported reasons for CAM use among migraine/headache sufferers?. This secondary analysis of data from the 2012 U.S. NHIS (a national cross-sectional survey) examined the use of CAM among migraine/headache sufferers, including the main reasons related to CAM use. Data were weighted and analyzed using STATA 14.0.. The sample of 34,525 adults included 6558 (18.7%) headache/migraine sufferers. Of the headache/migraine sufferers, a substantial proportion (37.6%, n = 2427) used CAM for various conditions; however, CAM use specifically for headache/migraine was much less prevalent (3.3%, n = 216). Of those who used CAM for headache/migraine, about half used CAM in conjunction with prescription (47.8%, n = 100) or over-the-counter medication (55.1%, n = 113). As severity of headache/migraine increased so did the likelihood of using CAM (severe migraine odds ratio [OR] = 2.32; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41, 3.82; both recurring headache/severe migraine OR = 3.36; 95% CI: 2.08, 5.43; when compared to those with recurring headache only). The most frequently used CAM modality among all headache/migraine sufferers (N = 6558) was manipulative therapy (22.0%, n = 1317), herbal supplementation (21.7%, n = 1389) and mind-body therapy (17.9%, n = 1100). The top 3 reasons for using CAM for headache were general wellness (28.7%, n = 60/209), improving overall health (26.8%, n = 56/209), and reducing stress (16.7%, n = 35/209).. Although CAM is used by many sufferers of headache/migraine, the use of CAM specifically for the treatment of headache/migraine is relatively low in the United States. The study also assesses the key differences of CAM use among headache/migraine sufferers in NHIS 2012 compared with those in NHIS 2007, and identifies shortfalls in the evidence-base of several CAM modalities used by U.S. adults for headache/migraine. This information may assist health providers and consumers in making informed decisions about the safest and most appropriate approach to managing headache/migraine.\n",

      "\t a: To characterize the phenotype, headache-related disability, medical co-morbidities, use of symptomatic headache medications, and headache response to study interventions in the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT).. Patients with untreated IIH and mild vision loss enrolled in the IIHTT and randomized to acetazolamide (ACZ) and weight loss or placebo (PLB) and weight loss had prospective assessment of headache disability using the Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) questionnaire. Subjects with headache at the baseline visit were assigned a headache phenotype using the International Classification for Headache Disorders version 3 beta (ICHD-3b). Medication overuse was determined using the participants' reported medication use for the preceding month and ICHD-3b thresholds for diagnosing medication overuse headache. We investigated relationships between headache disability and various other clinical characteristics at baseline and at 6 months.. Headache was present in 139 (84%) of the 165 enrollees at baseline. The most common headache phenotypes were migraine (52%), tension-type headache (22%), probable migraine (16%), and probable tension-type headache (4%). Fifty-one (37%) participants overused symptomatic medications at baseline, most frequently simple analgesics. A similar amount of improvement in the adjusted mean (± standard error) HIT-6 score occurred in the ACZ (-9.56 ± 1.05) and PLB groups (-9.11 ± 1.14) at 6 months (group difference -0.45, 95% CI -3.50 to 2.60, P = .77). Headache disability did not correlate with any of the studies, variables of interest, which included: the lumbar puncture opening pressure at baseline or at 6 months, body mass index, the amount of weight lost, papilledema grade, perimetric mean deviation, or the use of hormonal contraception. Headache disability was significantly associated with patient-reported quality of life in the physical, mental, and visual domains.. Headache was common, of varied character, disabling, and associated with poorer quality of life in our cohort of patients with mild visual impairment. The lack of correlation between headache disability and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure at baseline and at the end of the randomized phase of the study implies that headache in IIH may be related to factors other than intracranial hypertension, and that specific headache treatment is needed in addition to therapies directed at lowering CSF pressure.\n",

      "\t a: Craniocervical dystonia is a focal or segmental dystonia in its distribution, classically known as spasmodic torticollis when in its pure cervical presentation. Although craniocervical dystonia has been recognized as a possible cause of headache since the publication of the second version of International Classification of Headache Disorders, there are few studies about this entity.. This was a narrative review.. Craniocervical dystonia was associated with muscle pain in 67-89% of the cases. Headaches of any kind affected approximately 60% of patients with craniocervical dystonia, and were located mainly in the occipital and cervical regions. Headache attributed to craniocervical dystonia specifically was rarely found, and it was described in only one patient out of 80 in one study. Treatment with botulinum neurotoxin is considered to be the first-line treatment for focal dystonias, including craniocervical dystonia, and besides reducing clinical severity, impairment, and pain scores among the patients with craniocervical dystonia, there were also descriptions of improvements in headaches attributed to craniocervical dystonia and other headaches associated with this dystonia.. Headache attributed to craniocervical dystonia has been poorly studied. There is a need for more studies to evaluate its characteristics and treatment.\n",

      "\t a: Patients with chronic kidney disease who need dialysis often have poor quality of life. Dialysis headache is a frequent complication of hemodialysis and is often a challenge for nephrologists, neurologists, and headache specialists.. This was a narrative review.. The prevalence of dialysis headache varies between 27% and 73%. Among the characteristics of this headache are the pulsatile pattern, frontal location, moderate to severe intensity, and onset a few hours after the beginning of dialysis. The headache may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The physiopathology of hemodialysis headache is still not completely understood. Some factors that seem to be associated with it are variations in urea, sodium, magnesium, blood pressure, and weight levels. The hematoencephalic barrier has an important role. Variations in electrolyte and urea levels occur in the systemic circulation during hemodialysis, but the cerebral concentrations of these substances are stable over the first few hours of the procedure. The flow of free water through the hematoencephalic barrier may lead to cerebral edema. Other potential pathophysiological factors include nitric oxide, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and substance P. There are recommendations for maintenance of volume and control over electrolytes and blood pressure and avoidance of caffeine for prevention of hemodialysis headache. However, there are no controlled studies of prophylactic or abortive hemodialysis headache treatment.. Despite its prevalence, hemodialysis headache has been poorly studied, thus making it difficult to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in its genesis. Current clinical management practices are therefore necessarily empiric with minimal to no evidence base.\n",

      "\t a: There have been no prior studies assessing the status of undergraduate headache training and education in Singapore. Unmet needs of undergraduate medical students in terms of knowledge-practice gaps pertaining to diagnosis and management of headache disorders are unknown. The possible underemphasis of this aspect of the curriculum as compared to other chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus has also not been ascertained.. The aim of this article is to assess the knowledge base and perceptions, thereby identifying the unmet needs of headache disorder education in undergraduate medical students. Students reported their perceived time that was devoted to the subject matter and this was recorded and reported. In order to provide a comparative indication on the level of prioritization, the total duration within the syllabus dedicated to headache education vs other chronic diseases (using diabetes mellitus as a surrogate) was sought.. A comprehensive survey consisting of questions assessing the headache curriculum, knowledge, and perceptions was developed. The questionnaire was distributed to final year medical students attending a full-day Neurology review course in their last semester. Attendees were given the duration of the course to complete the questionnaire, and forms were collected at the end of the day.. About 127 final year medical students completed our survey. More than half (55.1%) did not receive formal teaching on how to take a complete headache history. The majority (90.6%) have not attended a headache sub-specialty clinic. The mean total number of hours exposed to headache disorders was 5.69h (SD ± 5.19). The vast majority (96.1%) were unfamiliar with locally published clinical practice guidelines, and a significant proportion (74.0%) were unfamiliar with the third edition (beta) of the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Nearly half (47.2%) were unfamiliar with 'medication overuse headache' as a disease entity. Only one (0.8%) respondent was able to correctly classify all listed primary and secondary headache disorders correctly. Only 37.0% were able to identify all 4 indications (headaches that were new, worsening, and unresponsive to treatment or associated with neurological symptoms) that warranted neuroimaging in a patient with a pre-existing diagnosis of migraine. The antidepressants were the most frequently reported incorrect option for the abortive treatment of migraine (16.5%). Nearly one-fifth (18.9%) were unable to name a single abortive treatment correctly, while a significant proportion (39.4%) could not identify a single correct prophylactic migraine treatment. A large proportion (62.2%) opined that their exposure to 'headache diagnosis and management' was inadequate, with a minority (3.1%) being 'very comfortable' in the diagnosing migraine. A significant proportion felt uncomfortable in treating special population groups diagnosed with migraine - pregnant (79.5%), elderly (48.0%), those with cardiac conditions (51.2%).. The current medical undergraduate curriculum on headache disorders in Singapore may harbor significant unmet needs. A review of the syllabus to increase headache education may be one method to address this gap. Further studies in this area are required.\n",

      "\t a: The prevalence of primary headache disorders in the general population provides a unique challenge in the evaluation of headache occurring in the context of sport. Despite a wealth of studies exploring the epidemiology of headache in the layperson, little is known about the prevalence and nature of headaches in collegiate student-athletes. These scenarios are challenging in the return to play context, as it is often unclear whether an athlete has an exacerbation of a primary headache disorder, new onset headache unrelated to trauma, or has suffered a concussive injury.. To establish the prevalence and nature of headaches in collegiate student-athletes.. Retrospective cross-sectional survey.. This cross-sectional survey evaluated the characteristics and prevalence of headache in 834 student-athletes from four NCAA Division-I institutions. Because headache occurrence may vary by sport (collision, contact, non-contact), by sex, and medical history, our sample included male and female athletes in a variety of sports, with differing degrees of contact exposure. The 20 question survey collected data on personal and family history of headache, as well as concussion history.. A total of 23.7% (n = 198) of participants reported having a personal history of migraine, 25.2% (n = 210) history of sinus headache, and 12.3% (n = 103) history of tension type headache. Among athletes with a prior history of concussion, 46.3% (n = 25) of females reported a history of migraine, while only 32.2% of males reported history of migraine (χ. The etiology of increased prevalence of migraine in our study is unclear. Whether this is due to increased awareness of headache disorders, a consequence of contact exposure, or a predisposition for migraine development in this age group remains unclear. Further studies are indicated.\n",
